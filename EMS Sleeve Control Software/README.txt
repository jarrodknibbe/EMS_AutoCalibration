This is the control circuitry for the sleeve. 

The code uses:
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- tkinter
- PIL
- matplotlib
- scipy
- serial

You may find that not all of these are actually necessary.

Start with 'gui.py' - this should guide you through the whole process. 

The code for the Arduino Mega is also included. This could be adapted so that different arduinos can be used, alongside more shift registers or multiplexers.
